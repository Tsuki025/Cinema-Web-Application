# Cinema-Web-Application
## WEB application supporting cinema management
The application is intended to enable the automation of certain processes related to work in the cinema, such as the ability to register purchased tickets on site at the cinema, a seat reservation system, reserving seats for screenings, managing employees, movies, work schedules, as well as planning screenings and generating statistics.

## FUNCTIONALITY

- browsing offers for a chosen day in the repertoire, allowing them to watch a movie trailer, read a short description, prices of standard and discount tickets, and the option to reserve seats for a selected screening.

**All employees (logged in users):**
- editing basic data such as name, surname, email, password.

**Owner or other user with administrator privileges:**
- movie database management.
- screening schedule management, which includes setting dates and times of screenings with the automatic option of assigning cleaning of the room after the screening.
- work schedule management.
- employee management.
- generating statistics based on tracking the popularity of a selected movie by summarizing the tickets sold for a chosen movie in a selected time period and for selected categories.

**Cleaner:**
- access to the work schedule, information on what time the employee works and which rooms he/she should clean at what time

**Ticket seller:**
- access to the work schedule, the ability to register purchased tickets by customers at the cinema headquarters, check reserved seats and release them in the event of lack of contact with the customer
